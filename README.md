# Project Name: Your Project Name

Welcome to the **Your Project Name** repository. This README provides guidelines on our coding conventions, project structure, and development practices to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.

## Code Conventions

We aim to maintain a clean and uniform codebase. Please adhere to the following conventions when contributing to this project.

### Directory Structure

Our project is organized into several key directories:

```bash
/project-root
|-- /apps
| |-- /backend # Backend Service
| |-- /frontend-client # NextJS application for the client
| |-- /frontend-dashboard # ReactJS Dashboard application
|-- /packages
| |-- /ui-components # Reusable UI components
| |-- /libs
| |-- /utils # Utility functions
| |-- /types # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Files and Folders

- **Files**: Use kebab-case for file names. Example: `user-profile.ts`, `login-form.tsx`.
- **Folders**: Use kebab-case for folder names. Example: `ui-components`, `order-processing`.

#### Code

- **Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase for identifiers.
  ```typescript
  let recordCount = 10;
  function fetchUserData() { ... }

- **Classes and Interface**: Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
  ```typescript
  class UserProcessor { ... }
  interface UserData { ... }

#### Functions
- Keep functions concise and focused on a single task.
- Clearly name functions to reflect their purpose.

#### Variables
- Use descriptive names, avoiding vague or generic terms.
- Avoid single-letter names except in short, localized loops.

#### React/NextJS Components
- Name React/NextJS components using PascalCase and match the file name with the component name.
- Place each component in its own folder with its associated styles and tests.

#### Commit Messages
- Use clear, concise commit messages in the imperative mood.
Example: "Add payment processing module", "Fix boundary error in cart calculation".

#### Pull Requests
- Describe changes thoroughly.
- Ensure code passes all tests and adheres to the coding standards set forth in this document.
